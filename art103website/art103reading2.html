      <p>My name is Ashley Rose and I am an interdisciplinary artist.  I explore various media in order to better my own ability to create narratives. The works in this portfolio represent my explorations in video and net art. These pieces allow me to explore other ways to go about my art.  My interests are video games, costume creation, writing, and watercolor painting.  I use each of these alongside video and net art to better my personal art.</p>
      <p>In most of my practice, I create work that gives my characters faces.  I find reference material for clothing, body types, and other features to more accurately represent my ideas of the characters I create.  Normally I work with pencil and colored pencil to sketch.  My art can also include additions in marker, watercolor, or other colored media.  I include writing on the page to explain my thought process not only to help myself later on, but also for others who would like to know more about my intentions for a character.  The works can include both pages or just the right page, mostly dependent on the character I am working on that day.  Whether I am working on a main character or simply an idea for a character, I approach each with the world they would inhabit in mind.</p></div>

        <p>Q1:  Walter de Maria’s works seem to be more about the locations they are in and working with what is natural.  Banksy’s use of location seems to be more about the audience found in the given environment.  Both cause the viewer to go out and find their works.  Banksy is more city based while Walter de Maria is more nature based. </p>
        <p>Q2:  Sign artists use language and images to show their point.  The content of the sign needs to be eye catching.  They all must have a clear message for the viewer and are site specific. </p>
        <p>Q3:  The yarn bombing that started up in 2017 is something is a combination of art and its environment.  The artists had to prepare their crocheted pieces before they went to install the.  Unlike graffiti, which it is often compared to, yarn bombing adds the feeling of tough to the piece.  One event in particular was the “bombing” of the Wall Street Bull.  The entire statue was covered in a fitted yarn sweater of sorts. </p>
        <p>An IMAGE will go here.</p>
