      <p>My name is Ashley Rose and I am an interdisciplinary artist.  I explore various media in order to better my own ability to create narratives. The works in this portfolio represent my explorations in video and net art. These pieces allow me to explore other ways to go about my art.  My interests are video games, costume creation, writing, and watercolor painting.  I use each of these alongside video and net art to better my personal art.</p>
      <p>In most of my practice, I create work that gives my characters faces.  I find reference material for clothing, body types, and other features to more accurately represent my ideas of the characters I create.  Normally I work with pencil and colored pencil to sketch.  My art can also include additions in marker, watercolor, or other colored media.  I include writing on the page to explain my thought process not only to help myself later on, but also for others who would like to know more about my intentions for a character.  The works can include both pages or just the right page, mostly dependent on the character I am working on that day.  Whether I am working on a main character or simply an idea for a character, I approach each with the world they would inhabit in mind.</p></div>

        <p>Q1. -- What is a good working definition of what a System is and perhaps what it is not? </p>
        <p>A system is a group of objects or other ideas that work together to make something happen.  </p>
        <p>Q2. -- For the 4 system definations you were to look up please give in your own words what they mean and give an example of them for each case. </p>
        <p>1 Modularity: when components can be arranged in a variety of ways</p>
        <p>2 Decomposibility: the point at which components cannot be broken down farther</p>
        <p>3 Emergence: when many components allow complex outcomes</p>
        <p>4 Chaos Theory: the unpredictibility within a system which can result in unexpected (often mistaken as random) outcomes </p>
        <p>Q3 -- Give us your defination of what Tessellation means and give an example you encountered, not mentioned in the reading. </p>
        <p>Tessellation is another word for tiling.  It involves various combinations of shapes, some use a single shape (where all the sides and angles match) while others mix various shapes.  I have seen tessellation in mosaic walkways, where all the shapes are the same.  A design was made with this form of tiling using colors.</p>
        <p>Q4 -- What is The difference between ideas of Modularity and Tesselation? What are the properties that are in oppostion with each other? </p>
        <p>Modularity allows for things to be interchanged, while Tesselation may not.  Modularity can be a form of tesselation.</p>
        <p>Q5 -- What is the difference between designing something that has Complexity (aperiodic) vs being Uniform (periodic)</p>
        <p>Complexity has no real pattern while Uniform follows a pattern.</p>
