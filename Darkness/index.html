    <h3>But there is a darkness that shrouds both.</h3>
    <p>Darkness covers the past.  No one knows what truly happened besides those who were there. We can only guess now.  Darkness covers the future.  No one knows what will happen.  We can guess and guess, but where will that take us?  The only comfort is the present.  Sure, we would love to return to the bright days of the nostalgic past.  Sure, we would love to take a glimpse at what the future holds.  But in the end, all we can do is reflect and adapt, for what is the future without the past.</p>
