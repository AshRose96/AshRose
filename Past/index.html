    <h2>What would it be like if you could look forward?</h2>
    <h3>To see the <a href="https://ashrose96.github.io/Future/">future</a> and all that is ahead.</h3>

      Dread in knowing things may not change, things may stay the same.  There is comfort in the past.  Even as memories fade and the future is all you can look forward to, the past is there to remind you to learn.
    Move forward with the knowledge that the future is very bright.  Life may feel dull, but it is bright when there is something to look forward to.  It all would be so easy if you could <a href="https://ashrose96.github.io/Future/">click to go forward.</a></p>
