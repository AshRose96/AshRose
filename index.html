  <h1>Hello Everyone! Welcome to my portfolio!</h1>
  <p>My name is Ashley Rose. I am an interdiciplinar artist. I explore various media in order to better my own ability to create narratives. The works in this portfolio represent my explorations in video and net art. </p>

    <p>In this video, I seek to critique the culture around videogame streamers. I, myself, am a gamer and do enjoy watching people play games. Streamers may run into the issue where their viewers all want a bit of their attention. </p>

    <p>The process that goes into creating anything is often forgotten once the product is created. Be it a film, a painting, or a piece oc clothing, there is generally a disconnect between the creation of something and the product most people see.
      With this project, I seek to bridge this divide.</p>

    <p>This piece seeks to make one think about the past and the future. Through imbedded links, one can flip between the past and future pages. Hidden on both pages is a secret link to a third page.</p>
