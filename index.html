<p>In this video, I seek to critique the culture around videogame streamers.  I, myself, am a gamer and do enjoy watching people play games.  Streamers may run into the issue where their viewers all want a bit of their attention.  </p>

<p>The process that goes into creating anything is often forgotten once the product is created.  Be it a film, a painting, or a piece oc clothing, there is generally a disconnect between the creation of something and the product most people see.  With this project, I seek to bridge this divide.</p>

<p>This piece seeks to make one think about the past and the future.  Through imbedded links, one can flip between the past and future pages.  Hidden on both pages is a secret link to a third page.</p>
