  <h1>Hello Everyone! Welcome to my portfolio!</h1>
  <p>My name is Ashley Rose and I am an interdisciplinary artist.  I explore various media in order to better my own ability to create narratives. The works in this portfolio represent my explorations in video and net art. These pieces allow me to explore other ways to go about my art.  My interests are video games, costume creation, writing, and watercolor painting.  I use each of these alongside video and net art to better my personal art.</p>
  <p>In most of my practice, I create work that gives my characters faces.  I find reference material for clothing, body types, and other features to more accurately represent my ideas of the characters I create.  Normally I work with pencil and colored pencil to sketch.  My art can also include additions in marker, watercolor, or other colored media.  I include writing on the page to explain my thought process not only to help myself later on, but also for others who would like to know more about my intentions for a character.  The works can include both pages or just the right page, mostly dependent on the character I am working on that day.  Whether I am working on a main character or simply an idea for a character, I approach each with the world they would inhabit in mind.</p>
